<p>History of coffee, the discovery and spread of coffee as a stimulating beverage.


    coffee cherries
    Ripe (red) and unripe (green) coffee cherries.
    Wild coffee plants (Coffea species) are thought to have been native to an Ethiopian plateau region known as Kefa (Kaffa), though the exact history of their origin and domestication remains unclear. One of many legends about the discovery of coffee is that of Kaldi, a goatherd who was puzzled by the strange antics of his flock. About 850 CE Kaldi supposedly sampled the berries of the evergreen bush on which the goats were feeding and, on experiencing a sense of exhilaration, proclaimed his discovery. At some point, perhaps as late as the 15th century, coffee plants were taken across the Red Sea to southern Arabia (Yemen) and placed under cultivation. Tradition holds that Sufi monks were among the first to brew coffee as a beverage and used the stimulation to pray through the night.</p>
